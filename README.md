# Customer-Churn-Analysis-Dashboard-using-Power-BI
A Power BI dashboard project analyzing telecom customer churn to identify key churn drivers, high-risk customers, and revenue impact using interactive visualizations.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn in the telecom industry using Power BI. The goal is to understand customer behavior, identify key factors contributing to churn, measure revenue impact, and provide actionable business recommendations to improve customer retention.

The analysis is based on a telecom customer dataset and is presented through an interactive, multi-page Power BI dashboard.
